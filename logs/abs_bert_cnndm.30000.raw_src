[CLS] ( cnn ) is america a nation divided ? [SEP] [CLS] and has ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions ?

[SEP] [CLS] adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite , and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self ##- ##int ##eres ##ts while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country .

[SEP] [CLS] ohio is much stronger today . [SEP] [CLS] and that turn ##around and success are worth being excited about and sharing . [SEP] [CLS] for example , we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $ 8 billion short ##fall to now having one of the nation ' ##s strongest state budgets and a nearly $ 2 billion surplus . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ve gone from losing 350 ##, ##00 ##0 private ##- ##se ##ctor jobs to creating about 340 ##, ##00 ##0 new ones . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ve gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in america , including tax cuts for the working poor . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re seeing wages grow faster than the national average and ohio ' ##s unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade .

[SEP] [CLS] he has something about him , as he showed when he was in mitchell johnson ' ##s face during the ashes series . [SEP] [CLS] he was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return . [SEP] [CLS] but i do believe he will need careful man ##- ##mana ##ging . [SEP] [CLS] peter moore ##s , england ' ##s coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with marlon samuel ##s in the second test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right .

[SEP] [CLS] shaw added : ` he has two sides to him , but he is genuinely a really nice guy and a great manager .

[CLS] washington ( cnn ) it ' ##s the mistake that hillary clinton wo n ##' ##t make again : ignoring her gender . [SEP] [CLS] the low ##- ##key video she released on sunday announcing her run for the white house is filled with women - ##- young , old , black , white , asian and latin ##a - ##- working in their gardens , taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world . [SEP] [CLS] clinton , who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007 , is barely in the video at all , appearing at the end as a kind of every ##woman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others . [SEP] [CLS] " i ' ##m getting ready to do something , too . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##m running for president , " clinton said in the video . [SEP] [CLS] " everyday americans need a champion , and i want to be that champion - ##- so you can do more than just get by - ##- you can get ahead . " [SEP] [CLS] clinton often says there ' ##s no better time in history to be born female than the present . [SEP] [CLS] she ' ##s now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation ' ##s first woman president . [SEP] [CLS] the challenge for clinton in breaking the " highest , hardest glass ceiling " that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters , while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history . [SEP] [CLS] clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics . [SEP] [CLS] there are historic numbers of women in congress , and the idea of " leaning in " is a catch phrase among professional women . [SEP] [CLS] meanwhile , the feminism label does n ##' ##t seem as charged as it once was - ##- people from beyonce to actor joseph gordon ##- ##lev ##itt are identifying as feminist . [SEP] [CLS] " as far as the political culture and culture in general , this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office . [SEP] [CLS] there is a willingness now to promote pro ##- ##wo ##men messages , " said jennifer law ##less , who runs the women & politics institute at american university . [SEP] [CLS] " people are ready for a woman president . [SEP] [CLS] the question is this : are they ready for hillary as that woman ?

[CLS] ( cnn ) hillary clinton finally answered the question we ' ##ve all been asking for years : will she run for president in 2016 ? [SEP] [CLS] with official news of her candidacy just hours old , one thing is already crystal clear : for the next year and a half , clinton will be the bar ##ometer by which we assess gender equality in the united states . [SEP] [CLS] win or lose , this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder . [SEP] [CLS] just consider the two potential outcomes . [SEP] [CLS] a win would mean a woman in the white house , which is a vital step in the march toward women ' ##s full political inclusion . [SEP] [CLS] but it ' ##s possible that the march will end right there . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we ' ##ve come . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##ll raise the " mission accomplished " banner over the women ' ##s movement . [SEP] [CLS] and we ' ##ll call it a day . [SEP] [CLS] granted , 80 % of elected officials throughout the country will still be men . [SEP] [CLS] women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office . [SEP] [CLS] and pay in ##e ##qui ##ties , sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve , no matter how hard clinton might try . [SEP] [CLS] " but we ' ##ve elected a woman as president , " we ' ##ll say . [SEP] [CLS] let her take care of it . [SEP] [CLS] a loss would be even more difficult . [SEP] [CLS] clinton will be blamed for running a sub ##par campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is . [SEP] [CLS] more generally , her loss would per ##pet ##uate the myth that women can not win big elections , that the electoral environment is ri ##fe with bias and discrimination , and that women must be twice as good to get half as far . [SEP] [CLS] " if hillary clinton ca n ##' ##t win an election , " potential female candidates will ask , " how can i ? " [SEP] [CLS] extra ##pol ##ating from one female candidate ' ##s experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect . [SEP] [CLS] but in the case of clinton , it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons . [SEP] [CLS] first , clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate , if there is such a thing . [SEP] [CLS] she began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve , and she is even more well ##- ##k ##now ##n today . [SEP] [CLS] but that means that she also enters the electoral arena

[CLS] ( cnn ) indiana ' ##s controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately . [SEP] [CLS] after a fires ##torm of backlash and protests , gov ##. mike pen ##ce said on tuesday that the state will " fix " the religious freedom restoration act , or rf ##ra , so it will not disc ##rim ##inate against gay ##s and lesbian ##s . [SEP] [CLS] pen ##ce is making the right call . [SEP] [CLS] promoting the false di ##cho ##tom ##y between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one . [SEP] [CLS] not all people who dislike the law hate religion , and not all people who like the law want to disc ##rim ##inate against the lgbt community . [SEP] [CLS] if people of good will come together , liberty and equality can both be saved . [SEP] [CLS] the un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly easy way to fix indiana ' ##s rf ##ra is to add one small amendment , one easy line cod ##ifying that discrimination against the lgbt community is harmful , and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm . [SEP] [CLS] in general , it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations . [SEP] [CLS] as americans , we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion . [SEP] [CLS] sometimes , a law seems to impose only modest burden ##s on the people it affects , but in practice it actually severely burden ##s the religious practices of a few . [SEP] [CLS] in those situations , if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burden ##some way - ##- and if no one else is harmed - ##- then religion should be granted an exemption . [SEP] [CLS] shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves ; it simply sends the message that religion is important , and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why , people should be allowed to practice as they need . [SEP] [CLS] these are the reasons why the federal rf ##ra was passed in 1993 , and why it had bi ##partisan support . [SEP] [CLS] these are whole ##some american values that everyone can get behind . [SEP] [CLS] the problem is that we no longer live in 1993 , 10 years before lawrence v ##. texas , and 20 before u ##. ##s ##. v ##. windsor . [SEP] [CLS] in 1993 , our sen ##si ##bilities were different ; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the lgbt community .

[CLS] a flaw in robots designed to perform surgery has been found that lets them be easily hacked , according to researchers . [SEP] [CLS] the experts were able to take control of a so ##- ##cal ##led tel ##ero ##bot during surgery by exploit ##ing a simple programming trick . [SEP] [CLS] this enabled them to change the speed of the arms of the robot and change their orientation , making it impossible for the machines to carry out a procedure as directed . [SEP] [CLS] researchers at the university of washington studied the tel ##ero ##bot raven ii ( shown ) . [SEP] [CLS] they found that robots designed for surgery could be ` easily ' hacked in to . [SEP] [CLS] this is because they are operated over public networks which allowed the researchers to access them and stop them working [SEP] [CLS] the research was carried out by scientists at the university of washington by toy ##ing with a product from their own university - the raven ii tel ##eo ##per ##ated robotic ##al surgeon . [SEP] [CLS] tel ##eo ##peration means an operator can use the robot remotely , through a control console . [SEP] [CLS] the first tel ##es ##urg ##ery took place in 2001 with a surgeon in new york successfully removing the gall bladder of a patient in france , more than 3 ##, ##7 ##30 miles ( 6 ##, ##00 ##0 km ) away . [SEP] [CLS] the communications ran over a dedicated fiber provided by a telecommunications company . [SEP] [CLS] but this is an expensive option since such fibers can cost tens of thousands of dollars . [SEP] [CLS] since then , surgeons have carried out remote operations and begun to experiment with ordinary communications links over the web , which are significantly cheaper . [SEP] [CLS] although there are no recorded incidents in which the communications infrastructure has caused problems during a tel ##es ##urg ##ery operation , there are still questions over security and privacy , said the experts . [SEP] [CLS] in the case of raven ii , a remote operator users two long and thin arms to perform complex procedures where otherwise their hands might not be capable . [SEP] [CLS] while this experiment was performed in a controlled environment and not on the operating table , the researchers said it ' ##s clear more string ##ent security measures are needed . [SEP] [CLS] raven ii runs on a single pc , and communicate ##s with a control console using a standard communications protocol known as inter ##oper ##able tel ##es ##urg ##ery protocol . [SEP] [CLS] but rather than take place over a secure private network , this takes place over public networks . [SEP] [CLS] ` due to the open and un ##con ##tro ##lla ##ble nature of communication networks , it becomes easy for malicious entities to jam , disrupt , or take over the communication between a robot and a surgeon

[SEP] [CLS] how we evolved into bilateral creatures , and what we evolved from , has been a cause of some debate .

[SEP] [CLS] wal ##mart ' ##s staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of arkansas came after the company said in february it would boost pay for about 500 ##, ##00 ##0 workers well above the federal minimum wage . [SEP] [CLS] taken together , the company is emerging as a bell ##we ##ther for shifting public opinion on hot ##- ##bu ##tton political issues that divide conservatives and liberals . [SEP] [CLS] and some prominent republicans are urging the party to take notice . [SEP] [CLS] former minnesota gov ##. tim paw ##lent ##y , who famously called on the go ##p to " be the party of sam ' ##s club , not just the country club , " told cnn that wal ##mart ' ##s actions " fore ##sha ##do ##w where the republican party will need to move . " [SEP] [CLS] " the republican party will have to better stand for " ideas on helping the middle class , said paw ##lent ##y , the head of the financial services round ##table , a washington lobbying group for the finance industry . [SEP] [CLS] the party ' ##s leaders must be " willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers , such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage , and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs , housing , public accommodation against gay ##s and lesbian ##s . " [SEP] [CLS] wal ##mart , which employs more than 50 ##, ##00 ##0 people in arkansas , emerged victorious on wednesday . [SEP] [CLS] hours after the company ' ##s ceo , doug mc ##mill ##on , called on republican gov ##. asa hutchinson to veto the bill , the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed . [SEP] [CLS] wal ##mart ' ##s opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the republican party , which the company ' ##s political action committee has tended to support . [SEP] [CLS] in 2004 , the wal ##mart pac gave around $ 2 million to republicans versus less than $ 500 ##, ##00 ##0 to democrats , according to data from the center for responsive politics . [SEP] [CLS] that gap has grown less pronounced in recent years . [SEP] [CLS]

[SEP] [CLS] but we remember him with tremendous affection . ' [SEP] [CLS] state funeral ##s in australia are generally reserved for politicians . [SEP] [CLS] even brad ##man himself turned down the offer of one before his death in 2001 . [SEP] [CLS] but such is the esteem in which ben ##aud was held , both as an engaging all ##- ##rou ##nd cricketer - ##- he took 248 test wickets with his leg ##- ##break ##s and scored 2 ##, ##20 ##1 runs - ##- and as a commentator , that abbott has been moved to make an exception .

[CLS] you get the impression around english cricket at the moment that people have a bit of a down ##er on stuart broad . [SEP] [CLS] i have heard the comment ` how much longer before broad comes under pressure for his place ? ' [SEP] [CLS] from a few people in recent times . [SEP] [CLS] there should always be scrutiny on england players ' places , i have no problem with that , but we have to be careful we do not get confused between broad the bowler and broad the batsman . [SEP] [CLS] fact is , in the last 14 tests broad has taken 63 wickets at 24 api ##ece which is pretty good considering he ' ##s been carrying ni ##ggles and injuries . [SEP] [CLS] so there has not been much wrong with his bowling even though , as i said on wednesday , he ' ##s not quite at his best following his long lay ##- ##off after surgery . [SEP] [CLS] stuart broad ( right ) was dismissed for a duck in england ' ##s first innings against west indies in antigua [SEP] [CLS] broad will always give you something different even though he can over ##do it at times , and has always had the ability to get something out of a flat pitch . [SEP] [CLS] i still like the fact that he can turn into the enforce ##r , as he did before lunch on day three , and that he ' ##s a clever bowler , as he showed on the second day when he rolled his fingers down the side of the ball and dismissed marlon samuel ##s with a leg ##- ##cut ##ter . [SEP] [CLS] broad and jimmy anderson are an outstanding combination , taking 52 ##6 wickets between them in the 70 tests they have played together - ##- a record that has seen them stand comparison with the partnership of sir ian both ##am and bob willis . [SEP] [CLS] the 28 ##- ##year ##- ##old has seen his place in the side questioned , but he still produces with the ball [SEP] [CLS] broad celebrates the wicket of den ##esh ram ##din on day three of the first test against west indies in antigua [SEP] [CLS] and they complement each other as we saw again on wednesday when it was flat and there was n ##' ##t much happening for anderson . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s when broad , with his ability to make things happen , is so crucial for a captain . [SEP] [CLS] he has an ability to come up with that magic spell , one that changes the whole course of a match as we have seen him do in big ashes tests .

[SEP] [CLS] viking orbit ##ers that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys .

[CLS] the worry for virgil van di ##jk is obvious . [SEP] [CLS] holland ' ##s national team have already conceded more goals in five euro 2016 qualifiers than they lost in the entire qualifying campaign for the last world cup . [SEP] [CLS] and still gu ##us hid ##din ##k never calls or writes . [SEP] [CLS] the celtic defender made it into two squads last year . [SEP] [CLS] but one step forward is usually followed by two steps back . [SEP] [CLS] when the dutch were drawing 1 ##- ##1 with turkey the other night he was sunni ##ng himself in the arabian gulf and bump ##ing into club ##- ##mates instead . [SEP] [CLS] virgil van di ##jk has been in fine form for celtic but was n ##' ##t rewarded with a call ##- ##up to the holland national team [SEP] [CLS] van di ##jk ' ##s last call ##- ##up to the dutch side came last year though he has never been capped by his country [SEP] [CLS] ` i saw stuart armstrong and callum mcgregor , ' he says in dead ##pan fashion . [SEP] [CLS] ` the better players were with their national teams . [SEP] [CLS] i was in dubai . ' [SEP] [CLS] a holiday in dubai is rarely a cause of self ##- ##pit ##y . [SEP] [CLS] yet van di ##jk ' ##s grip ##e is obvious . [SEP] [CLS] his breakthrough to the national squad was short ##- ##li ##ved and he ca n ##' ##t shake the na ##gging belief that he might have a better chance of playing for his country if he performed in a more respected league than the sp ##fl . [SEP] [CLS] celtic boss ron ##ny dei ##la denies this , using jason den ##ay ##er ' ##s belgium debut against israel by way of a counter argument . [SEP] [CLS] ` i do n ##' ##t think the belgian national team is any worse than the dutch , ' he insists . [SEP] [CLS] ` right now , it is better . [SEP] [CLS] so i do n ##' ##t think that is the answer . [SEP] [CLS] ` i do n ##' ##t know the level of the other central defenders in holland , but they must be very , very good to be better than virgil , in my opinion . ' [SEP] [CLS] van di ##jk ' ##s rivals for hid ##din ##k ' ##s attention ##s are stefan de vr ##ij , bruno martins ind ##i , jeffrey br ##uma and joel ve ##lt ##man . [SEP] [CLS] but they play in italy , portugal or holland . [SEP] [CLS] all three leagues have a better reputation than the sp ##fl and the worry for celtic is that van di ##jk knows it .

[SEP] [CLS] pa ##ed ##ia ##tric intensive care consultant dr peter wilson told the documentary : ` it does put clinic ##ians in an impossible position because we now have to try to explain to families why one child ... is getting a form of treatment , why they ca n ##' ##t and they ' ##ve got the same tu ##mour . [SEP] [CLS] ` that ' ##s deeply unfair when the nhs is supposed to be about equal healthcare for all .

[SEP] [CLS] ash ##ya was made a ward of court by portsmouth council before a national out ##cr ##y led to their release . [SEP] [CLS] his parents brett , 51 , and na ##gh ##me ##h , 46 , wanted him to have cutting ##- ##edge proton beam therapy instead which is thought to be less harmful . [SEP] [CLS] because it is so highly targeted they claimed it could avoid healthy tissue , particularly tissues and organs behind the tu ##mour . [SEP] [CLS] the family then went to prague for proton beam therapy , and now say there is ` no evidence ' of a tu ##mour [SEP] [CLS] a high court judge approved the move to take ash ##ya to prague for proton beam therapy . [SEP] [CLS] the nhs later agreed to fund ash ##ya ' ##s treatment in prague . [SEP] [CLS] in march , four months after the proton treatment ended , brett king told a national newspaper a recent scan showed ` no evidence ' of the tu ##mour .

[CLS] esa ' ##s rose ##tta spacecraft has captured stunning images of a dust jet er ##upt ##ing from comet 67 ##p chu ##ry ##um ##ov ##- ##ger ##asi ##men ##ko . [SEP] [CLS] the jet may have been caused by a wave of heat reaching ice trapped under the surface , causing an explosion of material . [SEP] [CLS] but it is unusual , because so far such activity has only been spotted on the day ##- ##side of the comet - not the night , like this . [SEP] [CLS] this animation shows the jet er ##upt ##ing from comet 67 ##p . [SEP] [CLS] the first image was taken at 7 ##: ##13 am bs ##t ( 2 ##: ##13 am est ) on 12 march , and the second was taken two minutes later . [SEP] [CLS] the jet is unusual because it is er ##upt ##ing from the dark underside of the comet , whereas such activity had only been seen on the day side so far . [SEP] [CLS] the two images , released yesterday , were taken by the os ##iri ##s camera on the rose ##tta spacecraft from a distance of 47 miles ( 75 ##km ) , according to esa . [SEP] [CLS] as the comet gets closer to the sun , its surface gets warmer , causing frozen gases to er ##upt from the surface , carrying dust particles . [SEP] [CLS] but it ' ##s not clear if this caused the jet - or an explosion of material caused by ice sub ##lim ##ating ( turning from solid to gas ) underground . [SEP] [CLS] in the first image , taken at 7 ##: ##13 am bs ##t ( 2 ##: ##13 am est ) on 12 march , the upper comet can be seen with several rays of dust illuminated by the sun , while the dark underside shows no such features . [SEP] [CLS] two minutes later though , in the second image , a spectacular new jet emerges from the dark side , hurling dust into space at 26 ##ft ( eight metres ) per second . [SEP] [CLS] ` this was a chance discovery , ' said os ##iri ##s principal investigator dr ho ##lge ##r si ##er ##ks from the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) in germany . [SEP] [CLS] ` no one has ever witnessed the wake ##- ##up of a dust jet before . [SEP] [CLS] it is impossible to plan such an image . ' [SEP] [CLS] how or why the activity occurred in the dark region of the comet , though , is not yet understood .

[SEP] [CLS] kaitlyn gran ##ado , 24 , a teacher at macarthur high school in irving , was first arrested on march 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15 ##- ##year ##- ##old student , and was released on bail .

[SEP] [CLS] according to the af ##fi ##dav ##it , seen by the star ##- ##tel ##eg ##ram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on january 18 and 19 across the road from another school in dallas . [SEP] [CLS] the abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between gran ##ado and one of the boys last month . [SEP] [CLS] she was arrested on march 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in april the previous year , according to the dallas morning news . [SEP] [CLS] she was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . [SEP] [CLS] at the time , detectives said they did n ##' ##t think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on march 24 , officers quiz ##zed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . [SEP] [CLS] a spokesman for the police department said : ` there was some discussion , some rumor ##ing , there may have been a second person involved .

[CLS] don mclean ( pictured ) is responsible american pie , the lyrics of which have been puzzled over for decades [SEP] [CLS] there has never been a popular song quite like it . [SEP] [CLS] for more than 40 years , its lyrics have been an enigma wrapped in an eight ##- ##and ##- ##a ##- ##hal ##f minute long rock ' ##n ##' roll puzzle . [SEP] [CLS] argued over by generations of geek ##y fans , dec ##ip ##hered and re ##- ##de ##ci ##pher ##ed by code ##- ##break ##ing rock ne ##rds and considered to be poetic reflections on mid ##- ##20 ##th century u ##. ##s ##. social history by even gr ##oo ##vier academics , it ' ##s called american pie . [SEP] [CLS] and this week its lyrics , hand ##- ##written in 1971 by a young folk singer called don mclean , were sold at auction in new york for more than $ 1 million . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s a lot of money for 18 sheets of paper , albeit with a lost seventh verse . [SEP] [CLS] but , to be honest , i rather think that whoever bought them got a bargain . [SEP] [CLS] because , in this age , when song lyrics have all but become meaningless , american pie illustrates , in a series of images , metaphor ##s and all ##usions , just what can be done within the frame of a melodic ##ally straightforward pop song . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s also a pa ##ean to education . [SEP] [CLS] mclean loves words , he says , ` almost as much as life ' . [SEP] [CLS] that may be a slight overs ##tate ##ment , but it shows . [SEP] [CLS] of course , like all poets , mclean did n ##' ##t give us a key to the riddle of what his song was about when he released his multi ##- ##mill ##ion ##- ##sell ##ing single . [SEP] [CLS] that would have spoiled it . [SEP] [CLS] ` it means i ' ##ll never have to work again , ' he would joke about how much money the song had made him , leaving us to work out for ourselves what the ` sad news on the doorstep ' was exactly , and why he ` could n ##' ##t take one more step ' when he read it . [SEP] [CLS] that was the easy part , of course , for anyone of my and his generation who learned about the death in a plane crash in 1959 of one of the first great singer ##- ##son ##g ##writer ##s of rock , buddy holly , when we read about it in the morning newspaper .

[SEP] [CLS] yesterday mr hu ##ssen , who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife fe ##tia , conceded they might have influenced the young ##ster , who would have been 13 at the time . [SEP] [CLS] ` the only reason we took her first time , was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go , ' he said . [SEP] [CLS] the rally was held against the treatment of ethiopian ##s in saudi arabia after human rights violations , and mr hu ##ssen , 47 , who is from ethiopia , said : ` we both lost many people back home , we wanted to try to get help for people back home , too many human rights violations there .

[CLS] a remote iron age fort built by the pic ##ts as a look out post on top of a 20 ##- ##foot ##- ##hi ##gh sea stack has been uncovered on the coast of scotland .

[SEP] [CLS] he said it was possible the fort , which is thought to date from the 5th to 6th century , could also have been a precursor to dunn ##ott ##ar castle , a medieval fortress built on the rocks of a head ##land less than quarter of a mile away .

[SEP] [CLS] yet for anyone staring at the heavens 98 ##, ##00 ##0 year from now , the constellation ##s could look very different indeed . [SEP] [CLS] martin var ##gic , a graphic designer from slovakia , has created a chart that shows how the most famous of the constellation ##s have changed from 50 ##, ##00 ##0 bc to 100 ##, ##00 ##0 ce .

[SEP] [CLS] the results suggest that many of the most distinctive constellation ##s will become almost un ##re ##co ##gni ##sable in the future and some may need to be renamed entirely . [SEP] [CLS] stars generate sounds on their surface in an unexpected way , according to new experimental evidence . [SEP] [CLS] of course , as space is a vacuum it is impossible to hear sound in space , but the discovery reveals a new way that fluids can interact to produce a sound - one with an extremely high frequency . [SEP] [CLS] the researchers found that , when material - dust or gas from nearby - falls onto a star , it can produce an extremely high pitched sound in the plasma . [SEP] [CLS] the researchers said the phenomenon is ` more common in younger stars ' that are still acc ##um ##ulating material from their surroundings . [SEP] [CLS] it would be less common in more mature stars , like our sun . [SEP] [CLS] the big dip ##per , for example , will change from looking like a pl ##ough to something that looks more like duck , while the proud form of leo will mu ##tate into an un ##re ##co ##gni ##sable shape . [SEP] [CLS] orion , named after the hunter in greek mythology , will lose his head and the cr ##ux will become little more than two parallel lines similar to an equals sign .

[SEP] [CLS] l ##yra would also have faced completely the wrong way 52 ##, ##00 ##0 years ago .

[SEP] [CLS] self ##- ##ty ##ing shoe ##lace ##s could become a reality after engineers designed a shoe that can automatically lace up , adjusting itself to the shape of your foot . [SEP] [CLS] pressure sensors in the shoe tell it when your foot is in position , triggering a tiny motor in the heel that pulls the lace ##s tight . [SEP] [CLS] when you want to take off the shoes , click your heels together twice and the motor will release a spring in the shoe ' ##s tongue , loosen ##ing the lace ##s so the foot ##wear can be slipped off .

[SEP] [CLS] possessing a fine left foot , ko ##ndo ##gb ##ia doubles up as a play ##maker , and also scored the first goal in the tie in the first leg against arsenal . [SEP] [CLS] having made his mark in both ligue 1 and la liga , you could say the frenchman is the perfectly well ##- ##rou ##nded midfielder , someone who would fit in seam ##lessly in the premier league ...

[CLS] sarcasm is often described as the lowest form of wit , but it seems you need the right kind of wits in the first place to be able to recognise it . [SEP] [CLS] ne ##uro ##sc ##ient ##ists have identified the area of the brain that is the key to picking up on when someone is being sarcastic . [SEP] [CLS] they found that people with damage to the right sa ##git ##tal st ##rat ##um - a bundle of white matter that lies between the cerebral cortex and sub ##cor ##tical structures in the brain - are unable to detect sarcasm . [SEP] [CLS] stroke patients with damage in the sa ##git ##tal st ##rat ##um in the right hemisphere of the brain ( shown in the image above ) were far poorer at detecting sarcasm when listening to sentences , according to the new research [SEP] [CLS] stroke survivors often suffer damage to this area of their brain and struggle to recognise when family and friends are being sarcastic . [SEP] [CLS] according to researchers at john hopkins medical school in baltimore , the level of damage to this area of the brain seems to directly affect a persons ability to detect sarcasm . [SEP] [CLS] used effectively , sarcasm can provide a devastating put down . [SEP] [CLS] but it turns out that it can also be a great mo ##tiv ##ator . [SEP] [CLS] employees who have to put up with a sarcastic colleague or boss are more creative than those who do n ##' ##t , a study has found . [SEP] [CLS] researchers claim that being exposed to sarcasm required more ` cognitive complexity ' , or the ability to see things from more than one angle . [SEP] [CLS] the inherent humour in the comments also def ##used the tension that comes with anger . [SEP] [CLS] the study will surprise anybody whose boss relies on mocking his employees to get the best out of them . [SEP] [CLS] professor ar ##gy ##e hill ##is , a ne ##uro ##logist at john hopkins medical school who oversaw the study , said : ` failure to recognize sarcasm can lead to important mis ##com ##mun ##ication ##s . [SEP] [CLS] ` few previous studies have identified brain lesions associated with impaired recognition of sarcasm . ' [SEP] [CLS] percent damage to the sa ##git ##tal st ##rat ##um had the greatest weight and was the only independent predict ##or of sarcasm recognition .

[SEP] [CLS] gibbons - better known for their deafening songs that rev ##er ##ber ##ate around the forests they inhabit - have been found to regularly use the secretive form of communication . [SEP] [CLS] the apes , which are found in the forest of south east asia , produce a variety of soft call types , known as ` ho ##os ' , that are almost ina ##udi ##ble to the human ear . [SEP] [CLS] lars gibbons like this one in k ##ha ##o ya ##i national park thailand use soft ` ho ##o ' calls that are similar to whispers [SEP] [CLS] yet scientists have found the animals use these whispers to communicate specific information to each other about predators , foraging and when meeting neighbours . [SEP] [CLS] the researchers found that predator ` ho ##os ' in particular were produced at frequencies well below the threshold of hearing for eagles and other birds of prey . [SEP] [CLS] a dictionary that deco ##des the calls produced by gibbons is being developed by scientists . [SEP] [CLS] researchers at wisconsin university in madison have been using computer algorithms to anal ##yse the who ##ops and songs produced by the apes . [SEP] [CLS] gibbons singing usually consists of a cr ##es ##cend ##o of notes , particularly in response to predators . [SEP] [CLS] this usually starts with a series of soft ` ho ##o ' noises that are only audible at close range but this rapidly grows to become much louder . [SEP] [CLS] in most studied cases these songs are produced in response to predators but they also duet together in social song . [SEP] [CLS] this suggests the quiet calls were designed to alert other gibbons nearby without alert ##ing the rap ##tors . [SEP] [CLS] similarly biologist ##s studying la ##r gibbons found they used a different whisper call to when a tiger or leopard was in the area . [SEP] [CLS] dr esther clarke , who led the research at the university of durham , said the findings could also help to provide valuable clues about human speech evolved and perhaps even why humans began using whispers . [SEP] [CLS] she told mail online : ' ( ho ##o calls ) have been overlooked in favour of the more conspicuous songs . [SEP] [CLS] ` we just did n ##' ##t know they were using context ##- ##sp ##ec ##ific calls at close range . [SEP] [CLS] ` it opens up the possibility that their vocal repertoire is much larger than we previously imagined . ' [SEP] [CLS] she added : ` these animals are extra ##ord ##ina ##rily vocal creatures and give us the rare opportunity to study the evolution of complex vocal communication in a non ##- ##hum

[CLS] ( cnn ) recently , a new york judge issued an opinion author ##izing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via facebook . [SEP] [CLS] what exactly is " service of process " ? [SEP] [CLS] serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premise ##d on one guiding principle : if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it . [SEP] [CLS] in practice , it turns out people do n ##' ##t like being sued . [SEP] [CLS] it also turns out that , to many defendants , pro ##cr ##ast ##ination of a lawsuit is a viable defense . [SEP] [CLS] just as you may avoid bad news in life , defendants tend to avoid process servers . [SEP] [CLS] once a defendant has been served , that means the judicial proceedings begin . [SEP] [CLS] unfortunately , that means defendants have an incentive to go " off the grid " . [SEP] [CLS] although every state is different , the law of service of process has evolved this way : the ideal and fair ##est way to not ##ify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person , and have some proof that the person was the defendant . [SEP] [CLS] in ##- ##person service is not always possible , for obvious reasons . [SEP] [CLS] so , the law had to develop methods of alternate service , but carefully balance a defendant ' ##s right to have notice of a lawsuit , against a dil ##igen ##t plaintiff ' ##s access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable . [SEP] [CLS] as reliable as the u ##. ##s ##. mail is , regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers . [SEP] [CLS] not because the post ##men ca n ##' ##t be trusted ; they can . [SEP] [CLS] neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night , will keep them from delivering those papers . [SEP] [CLS] instead , it ' ##s defendants - ##- no wait , all of humanity - ##- that ca n ##' ##t be trusted . [SEP] [CLS] every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we did n ##' ##t get it . [SEP] [CLS] one form of alternate service is " nail and mail " service . [SEP] [CLS] this means that you take a hammer and nail , and nail the papers to the defendant ' ##s front door . [SEP] [CLS] the problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature . [SEP] [CLS] just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at , does n ##' ##t mean he ' ##ll be back there anytime soon . [SEP] [CLS] another , even odd ##er form of " service " is service

[CLS] a report suggests that carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels could be captured and used to produce the fi ##zz in cola ( stock image shown ) [SEP] [CLS] we may be told that fi ##zzy drinks are n ##' ##t good for our health , but there ' ##s a chance that they could be beneficial to the planet . [SEP] [CLS] an australian government report suggests that carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels could be captured and used to produce the fi ##zz in cola . [SEP] [CLS] many nations are looking into carbon capture and storage ( cc ##s ) technologies as a way to cut their greenhouse house emissions , of which carbon dioxide plays a large role . [SEP] [CLS] cc ##s refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in por ##ous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs . [SEP] [CLS] the technology has the potential to reduce the emissions of a typical coal ##- ##power plant by up to 90 per cent , but there are concerns over storing such huge amounts of carbon underground . [SEP] [CLS] the government ' ##s energy white paper has an idea of how to overcome this . [SEP] [CLS] after noting that industrial processes , which rely on the combustion of fossil fuels , are responsible for a significant proportion of australia ' ##s carbon dioxide emissions , it says : ` if the co ##2 can be captured before it is released to the atmosphere it can either be ut ##ilised in other products or permanently stored in deep geological formations . [SEP] [CLS] ` australia has worked closely with other countries which rely heavily on fossil fuels to investigate opportunities to ut ##ilis ##e co ##2 in products such as carbonate ##d drinks and plastics or to enhance the growth of oil ##- ##rich algae in solar bio ##rea ##ctors to produce bio ##fu ##el . ' [SEP] [CLS] this implies that as well as investigating the production of bio ##fu ##els , carbon dioxide could be st ##ash ##ed in fi ##zzy drinks . [SEP] [CLS] however , the report goes on to note that : ` while these processes are promising , there is no commercial co ##2 re ##- ##use in australia , largely reflecting the high cost of capturing the co ##2 from a flu ##e gas stream . ' [SEP] [CLS] of course , cans of fi ##zzy drinks emi ##t gas when they are opened , as shown by the sharp hissing noise , and there is no mention of how this gas could be captured too . [SEP] [CLS] the register obtained consumption data from the australian bureau of statistics that suggest 94 ##4 million litres of fi ##zzy drinks are consumed in australia in a year .

" [SEP] [CLS] hermann was able to spend about 10 days at the market , and did not allow any challenges to hind ##er the completion of " flower man .

[CLS] ne ##uro ##sc ##ient ##ists have succeeded in creating ` ghosts ' in the laboratory by trick ##ing the brains of test subjects into feeling an unexpected ` presence ' in the room . [SEP] [CLS] the sp ##ook ##y experiment which con ##jured up a ghostly illusion in the laboratory has proved once and for all that it ' ##s only our mind playing tricks .

[SEP] [CLS] the scientists say the experiment that what some people believe to be a ghostly presence is just a trick of the brain . [SEP] [CLS] ` this confirms that it is caused by an altered perception of their own bodies in the brain , ' said professor olaf blank ##e of the ecole poly ##tech ##ni ##que federal ##e de lausanne ( ep ##fl ) in switzerland [SEP] [CLS] blind ##fold ##ed and wearing ear ##- ##pl ##ug ##s , test subjects performed movements with their hand attached to a robotic device .

[SEP] [CLS] when conducted in real time , the participant ' ##s brain could adapt and recognize it as their own movement because of the synchronized movement . [SEP] [CLS] however , when the scientists introduced a temporal delay of just a few mill ##ise ##con ##ds , the di ##stor ##ting of temporal and spatial perception induced the ` ghostly ' feeling . [SEP] [CLS] the sensation was re ##- ##cre ##ated by researchers using a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blind ##fold ##ed volunteers . [SEP] [CLS] under normal circumstances the brain is able to form a unified self ##- ##per ##ception , but lead researcher olaf blank ##e explained that when this mal ##fu ##nction ##s the brain creates a second representation of its body . [SEP] [CLS] ` most of the research predict ##s that we can not tick ##le ourselves because our brain precisely predict ##s of one hand , of my hand , touching my body or touching one or another position . [SEP] [CLS] however , if this is not fully integrated because i ' ##m doing it or if i can not correctly predict because somebody else were to touch me ; in those cases of uncertainty , very often in those cases of double touch , the response is that you feel tick ##lish or tick ##led by somebody else , ' said blank ##e who is leading the research at the swiss federal institute of technology in lausanne , switzerland ( ep ##fl ) .

[CLS] anyone who has witnessed a game of hockey or netball might disagree , but men really are more competitive than women , according to a new study . [SEP] [CLS] researchers have discovered that male athletes are more driven by the desire to beat the competition than female athletes . [SEP] [CLS] sports ##wo ##men tend to be more committed to aspects of their lives outside sport - such as their academic studies - than their male counterparts , the researchers say . [SEP] [CLS] the researchers found that male 5 ##, ##00 ##0 metre runners are more competitive than women . [SEP] [CLS] great britain ' ##s mo far ##ah is pictured above running to victory in the european athletics championships in helsinki , finland [SEP] [CLS] this may explain why boys are often seen as being more competitive . [SEP] [CLS] however , the researchers say that there can be a great deal of individual variability with some women actually showing greater competitive drive than most male athletes . [SEP] [CLS] many reasons have been suggested to explain why women remain poorly represented in senior positions at large companies . [SEP] [CLS] now , a new study may shed light on workplace dynamics , by claiming that while men enjoy competition in the office , women like to be part of a team . [SEP] [CLS] the results suggest than men have a dim ##mer view of their colleagues ' ability than women and were therefore more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work , rather than that of a team ' ##s . [SEP] [CLS] researchers from cn ##rs ##- ##gate in lyon and the university of california , anal ##yse ##d the behaviour of both sexes when the study participants were asked to choose between being paid on their individual performance or as part of a team . [SEP] [CLS] they found that less than 11 per cent of men opted for team payment , in comparison to 44 per cent of women . [SEP] [CLS] these individuals tend to be far less common in women ' ##s sport , they said . [SEP] [CLS] the study could have implications for other areas outside sport , such as in the workplace where greater gender diversity could bring advantages . [SEP] [CLS] professor robert dean ##er , a psychologist at grand valley state university in michigan , said they studied elite runners because it is a sport that is equally popular among men and women and there is no di ##spar ##ity in prize money . [SEP] [CLS] he said : ` of course , we need to be careful not to assume that our running results will general ##ise to all sports or all domains outside of sports . [SEP] [CLS] ` nevertheless , our findings do echo those from other studies , which show that even when men and women hold the same selective jobs , men are more likely to

[CLS] ( cnn ) mountain ##eers have returned to mount everest for this year ' ##s climbing season , res ##uming the quest to summit the world ' ##s highest peak after a deadly season last year .

[SEP] [CLS] president kennedy encountered the same dilemma : " it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest , to wait . [SEP] [CLS] but ... this country of the united states was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them . " [SEP] [CLS] we need not be frightened today .

[SEP] [CLS] if graves , who has apparently assured senior figures that he does not want pieter ##sen back , really had no intention of encouraging the maverick , then he has made a right old mess of it .

[CLS] ( cnn ) change is coming to ferguson . [SEP] [CLS] in the next few weeks the department of justice ( do ##j ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to rest ##ru ##cture the police department , which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination . [SEP] [CLS] it should not be forgotten that the do ##j review of the ferguson police department was pre ##ci ##pit ##ated by months of protests and activism following the killing of michael brown by a ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town ' ##s dysfunction ##al government and court system by local civil rights law groups . [SEP] [CLS] now , after a half year of unrest , and with citizens on tuesday elect ##ing two new black city council members , change is beginning to come to ferguson . [SEP] [CLS] the question is , what kind of change ? [SEP] [CLS] the report from the department of justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that prey ##ed on its own citizens . [SEP] [CLS] through illegal traffic stops and arrests , and the use of excessive force , the police department held town residents in bond ##age . [SEP] [CLS] the municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor in ##fra ##ctions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time . [SEP] [CLS] court costs and fees constituted the second ##- ##lar ##ges ##t sources of revenue for the town . [SEP] [CLS] rather than a force for public safety , the ferguson police department became , according to attorney general eric holder , " a collection agency " - ##- one that prey ##ed di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ately on the town ' ##s african ##- ##ame ##rica ##n residents . [SEP] [CLS] the evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating .

[SEP] [CLS] ferguson ' ##s ugly , racist emails released [SEP] [CLS] the recommendations in the report , ranging from new training and supervision of police officers , addressing racial ##ly disc ##rim ##inatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system , will , if implemented , remake the law enforcement system in the town .

[SEP] [CLS] as the world await ##s the impending birth of william and kate ' ##s second baby , potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate . [SEP] [CLS] girls ' names are causing the biggest stir , as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess . [SEP] [CLS] if the assumptions are correct , she will be the first princess of cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years . [SEP] [CLS] the birth of any baby is cause for celebration , but given recent changes in the laws of succession , her arrival would be a historical one . [SEP] [CLS] in choosing a name , titled royals tend to turn to the family tree , rather than a well ##- ##th ##umb ##ed copy of " 1 ##, ##00 ##1 best baby names " like the rest of us . [SEP] [CLS] traditionally they pick d ##yna ##stic names , and there are plenty to choose from : elizabeth , alice , victoria and charlotte have all been front ##runner ##s , but the sentimental favorite among punt ##ers remains diana . [SEP] [CLS] in a recent today show poll , 32 % of americans predicted the name was a sho ##o ##- ##in , and in the uk the book ##ies ' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as diana becomes an increasingly popular choice . [SEP] [CLS] that said , in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl , i would hope that they do not opt to name her diana . [SEP] [CLS] today diana ' ##s name is as di ##vis ##ive as the very institution of monarchy itself : while some have virtually sainte ##d her , others have been ve ##hem ##ently critical , accusing her of being childish , un ##hing ##ed and self ##- ##ser ##ving .

[SEP] [CLS] tests suggest that tattoos in dark and solid colours interfere with the device the most . [SEP] [CLS] this is because the heart sensor reads a pulse by measuring light absorption though the skin - a process called photo ##ple ##thy ##smo ##graphy .

[CLS] some people like to run with a dog as a companion , while others use a ` smart ' accessory to keep track of the progress they ' ##ve made . [SEP] [CLS] but now a team of researchers has devised a new jogging buddy - a drone that flies with you to keep you company . [SEP] [CLS] and they claim robotic companions could be used for a variety of other physical activities such as cycling , cross ##- ##co ##unt ##ry skiing and rowing . [SEP] [CLS] australian researchers have tested their drone running companion . [SEP] [CLS] called jo ##gg ##ob ##ot ( shown ) it is designed to float in front of jo ##gger when they run .

[SEP] [CLS] and it could be used for other sports like cycling and rowing [SEP] [CLS] the research , by the royal melbourne institute of technology in australia , reported popular science , was presented at the computer ##- ##hum ##an interaction conference in seoul . [SEP] [CLS] in their paper , the researchers explained how they asked 13 jo ##gger ##s to run for an average of 26 minutes with a drone - specifically a quad ##co ##pt ##er - as a companion . [SEP] [CLS] the goal was to see if a drone could mo ##tiv ##ate a runner to keep their pace up , and provide a companion that helped them stay fit . [SEP] [CLS] in this experiment , the quad ##co ##pt ##ers were programmed to follow a set path and speed , which the jo ##gger ##s also followed . [SEP] [CLS] the drone was designed to fly 13 ##ft ( four metres ) in front of the jo ##gger at a height of 10 ##ft ( three metres ) . [SEP] [CLS] each participant was fitted with a go pro camera and , after finishing their run of between 15 and 40 minutes , gave their thoughts on having a robot companion . [SEP] [CLS] most said that they found it was a good ` pace keeper ' , especially on straight sections of their run . [SEP] [CLS] technology has been developed where a drone could lock onto a pattern on a runner ' ##s shirt in order to track their speed and direction , although this has n ##' ##t been implemented yet .

[CLS] they are the heart of the home , the hub of dinner parties and usually the ` de ##bri ##ef of the day ' meeting room . [SEP] [CLS] so what makes a great kitchen ? [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a balance between a warm and inviting design combined with practical efficiency . [SEP] [CLS] after judging the kitchens on the block last week and taking into account what buyers look for in a kitchen , property buyers expert frank vale ##nti ##c gives his tips for ensuring great kitchen design . [SEP] [CLS] the key to ensuring the practical ##ity of your kitchen is to zone areas of the kitchen based on activities e ##. ##g ##. food preparation , cooking , clean ##- ##up etc ##. with storage for those activities within those zones . [SEP] [CLS] these areas need to be easily accessible to each other and flow well ( e ##. ##g ##. food preparation near the cooking area etc ##. ) . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s no use in a pretty kitchen when your preparation area is on the opposite end of the kitchen from your stove ##top . [SEP] [CLS] this is one of the most common bug ##be ##ars when buyers are looking at kitchens . [SEP] [CLS] enough bench ##/ ##co ##unt ##er space is crucial not only for food preparation but also for serving when entertaining . [SEP] [CLS] there was plenty of bench space in dea and darren ' ##s kitchen on the block [SEP] [CLS] plenty of storage space is essential and you need to find a good balance between design aesthetics and practical ##ity . [SEP] [CLS] take into account what ' ##s most important for you in terms of storage , as i recommended a walk ##- ##in pantry vs a butler ' ##s pantry , consider whether having extra space for preparation and a large area to hide your appliances is paramount to you or whether a larger area for food storage is more vital . [SEP] [CLS] judge neal ##e whitaker said dea and darren ' ##s kitchen ` did n ##' ##t have their usual the flare , confidence or pizza ##zz ' [SEP] [CLS] as the buyer ' ##s advocate jury discussed when viewing josh and charlotte ' ##s kitchen , it ' ##s not an area of the home that you can get away with the ` bare bones ' when it comes to lighting . [SEP] [CLS] for the purpose of safety in food preparation and cooking , good lighting is paramount . [SEP] [CLS] specifically in the preparation , cooking and cleaning areas , it ' ##s essential to have good quality lighting . [SEP] [CLS] josh and charlotte ' ##s kitchen lacked lighting above the bench ##top according to frank vale ##nti ##c [SEP] [CLS] in the cooking and cleaning zones of the kitchen , splash ##backs are important and while design is also important ,
[CLS] sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders are more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than others , a recent study claimed [SEP] [CLS] the implication is that the potential for committing a sex offence may be written in our genes - but while this is an interesting finding , it is unlikely to help prevent sex crimes or catch offenders . [SEP] [CLS] this is because the genes that make up the people who we are , and the environments in which we are raised can not be considered independently of each other . [SEP] [CLS] the brothers of men convicted of sex offences are five times more likely than average to commit similar crimes , a study found . [SEP] [CLS] johnny sa ##vil ##e ( left ) is accused of abu ##sing seven women , while jimmy sa ##vil ##e ( right ) raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals during a 24 year reign of abuse [SEP] [CLS] the research anal ##yse ##d dna from 21 ##, ##56 ##6 men convicted of sex offences in sweden between 1973 and 2009 . [SEP] [CLS] it found that sons and brothers of convicted sex offenders were four to five times more likely to be convicted of sex crimes than men in the general population . [SEP] [CLS] in seeking to explain this connection , the researchers found that in only 2 per cent of cases could this fa ##mi ##lia ##l connection be explained by shared environmental factors . [SEP] [CLS] this can include social or environmental aspects of their upbringing that siblings would have experienced together . [SEP] [CLS] on the other hand , their shared genetics were a factor in 40 per cent of cases , with the remaining 58 per cent of cases stemming from environmental factors not shared between family members . [SEP] [CLS] genetic factors were also found to be stronger for child mole ##station ( 46 per cent ) than for adult rape ( 19 per cent ) . [SEP] [CLS] while the study makes an estimate of the her ##ita ##bility of sexual off ##ending , it can not of course pin ##point the genes that might be involved . [SEP] [CLS] dr mai ##ri levi ##tt says that genetic material from both parents is passed on , but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment [SEP] [CLS] putting a figure on the genetic basis for behaviour seems to suggest that these factors are inherited directly by the children from their parents . [SEP] [CLS] of course genetic material from both parents is passed on , but genetic traits are developed through interaction between genes and the environment . [SEP] [CLS] as can be seen from the percentage ##s above , the largest proportion of cases involved a large , rag bag of environmental factors that are by far the greatest influence on behaviour .

[CLS] tulsa , oklahoma ( cnn ) amid growing scrutiny over whether a 73 ##- ##year ##- ##old volunteer deputy who killed a suspect during a sting operation was qualified to be policing the streets , a new report raises a tr ##ou ##bling all ##ega ##tion .

[SEP] [CLS] at the time of the announcement , the school ' ##s governors failed to release any more details . [SEP] [CLS] however , an investigation by this newspaper has discovered that mr gale - ##- who became the academy ' ##s first male head when he was appointed to the post 18 months ago - ##- sent informal emails over a period of months to the sixth ##- ##form pupil , including messages written at night and during the holidays . [SEP] [CLS] school rules strictly forbid teachers sending messages to pupils from private email accounts . [SEP] [CLS] the che ##am academy has described mr gale ' ##s actions a ` serious breach of safeguard ##ing procedures ' . [SEP] [CLS] despite this , the national union of teachers appeared to play down the seriousness of his conduct . [SEP] [CLS] in a statement to the mail on sunday , the union implied mr gale ' ##s actions only amounted to a breach of the school ' ##s information and communications technology rules . [SEP] [CLS] the governors - ##- who began their investigation following a tip ##- ##off - ##- are said to have been ` stunned ' by the nut statement . [SEP] [CLS] the specialist science college and languages school , which counts singer katie mel ##ua and olympic gold medallist joanna rows ##ell among its alumni , passed judgment on mr gale at an internal disciplinary hearing earlier this month , ruling he had broken rules in place to prevent personal communications between staff and pupils . [SEP] [CLS] it is understood this was in breach of guidance telling teachers never to use a private email account to send messages to pupils , partly for their own protection . [SEP] [CLS] the school has refused to reveal the precise content of the emails , but it is understood they were informal and read like text messages . [SEP] [CLS] it is believed there were also concerns about the way mr gale , the former deputy headmaster of all ##- ##girl rose ##bery school in nearby eps ##om , had treated the student differently from other pupils .

[SEP] [CLS] he only sign up for cards with high sign ##- ##up bonuses and relatively low spending threshold ##s necessary to get those . [SEP] [CLS] for example , a card he just got gave 50 ##, ##00 ##0 bonus points for spending $ 1 ##, ##00 ##0 in three months . [SEP] [CLS] the writer makes a point of putting all everyday spending on credit cards in order to hit these spending threshold ##s . [SEP] [CLS] ( unfortunately , this is mostly true for american travellers ; european credit cards and elsewhere tend to offer fairly me ##ag ##re per ##ks . ) [SEP] [CLS] as long as you can handle credit res ##pon ##si ##bly and treat your credit card like a de ##bit card , you can work towards a surprising amount of free travel . [SEP] [CLS] my favourite credit card is almost always whichever one offers the best sign ##- ##up bonus at the time . [SEP] [CLS] so right now , the best three are american airlines ' ci ##ti platinum card , the united mile ##age ##pl ##us explorer card , and british airways visa signature card , each of which offers a sign ##- ##up bonus of 50 ##, ##00 ##0 miles . [SEP] [CLS] ( for complicated reasons , i probably like the ba card the best , because if you ' ##re flying less than 650 miles , 50 ##, ##00 ##0 miles will get you as many as 11 free flights . ) [SEP] [CLS] i basically ignore the ` get one mile for every dollar you spend ' incentive , since i do n ##' ##t have much money to spend .

[SEP] [CLS] the study has also raised the prospect of bringing the giant mammal back to life using cl ##oning techniques with modern elephants . [SEP] [CLS] scientists claim to have taken a major step towards rec ##rea ##ting the wool ##ly mammoth by insert ##ing more than a dozen of the creature ' ##s genes into the live dna of an elephant . [SEP] [CLS] researchers studied the structure of dna from mammoth ##s preserved in the arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal ' ##s genes .

[CLS] ( cnn ) if there was ever any doubt that the obama administration ' ##s clean power plan is an energy policy plan , not a carbon reduction plan , all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy . [SEP] [CLS] nuclear is our largest source of carbon ##- ##free energy , generating over 60 % of our carbon ##- ##free electricity . [SEP] [CLS] surely president barack obama ' ##s climate plan , allegedly aimed at reducing the united states ' overall carbon emissions , would rev ##ital ##ize the nuclear industry , lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets . [SEP] [CLS] james hansen , the former head of nasa ' ##s goddard institute for space studies , said in 2013 that " continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity ' ##s ability to avoid dangerous climate change . " [SEP] [CLS] yet wednesday , the white house will celebrate earth day and promote its work to fen ##d off climate change , while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions - ##- nuclear energy - ##- as well as the warning of one of the administration ' ##s favorite climate scientists . [SEP] [CLS] despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon ##- ##free , the obama administration ' ##s energy policy plan is biased against it . [SEP] [CLS] this bias is created by how environmental protection agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation . [SEP] [CLS] epa ' ##s modeling is divorced from reality . [SEP] [CLS] first , epa ' ##s " base case for the proposed clean power plan " pu ##rp ##ort ##s to depict the current state of the industry as the future would un ##fold without the clean power plan . [SEP] [CLS] this base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 205 ##0 . [SEP] [CLS] epa ' ##s implementation modeling , " option 1 - ##- state , " shows exactly the same situation : no new construction and 96 retirement ##s by 205 ##0 . [SEP] [CLS] in other words , epa assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 205 ##0 . [SEP] [CLS] these assumptions are tremendous ##ly important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets . [SEP] [CLS] a group of university of tennessee graduate students made this point to epa at a public hearing last summer . [SEP] [CLS] using epa ' ##s own data , the graduate students showed that epa ' ##s energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants .

[SEP] [CLS] he was bowling really well for burnley , and she rang up john stan ##worth , who was at the club at the time . [SEP] [CLS] jimmy was invited for trials by lancashire and that was that .

[CLS] google launched a new u ##. ##s ##. wireless service today that switches between wi ##- ##fi and cellular networks [SEP] [CLS] google is already the world ' ##s most popular phone software provider , and a pay ##- ##tv operator - and now it wants to be your mobile network carrier . [SEP] [CLS] the company has unveiled a u ##. ##s ##. wireless service that switches between wi ##- ##fi and cellular networks to curb data use and keep phone bills low . [SEP] [CLS] the service , called ` project fi , ' debuted today , about two months after google revealed its plans to expand its ever ##- ##gr ##owing empire into providing wireless connections for smartphone ##s . [SEP] [CLS] google is selling the basic phone service for $ 20 a month and will only charge customers for the amount of cellular data that they use each month , instead of a flat rate . [SEP] [CLS] each gig ##aby ##te of data will cost $ 10 a month . [SEP] [CLS] that means a customer could sign up for a plan offering three gig ##aby ##tes of data and get $ 20 back if only one gig ##aby ##te was used in a month . [SEP] [CLS] most wireless phone carriers allow their customers to roll over unused data into another month of service without ref ##und ##ing any money . [SEP] [CLS] project wi ##- ##fi initially will only be sold to a narrow us audience that owns the nexus 6 , a smartphone that motorola mobility made with google ' ##s help . [SEP] [CLS] google ' ##s pricing setup makes project fi less expensive than most of the comparable plans offering by the four biggest wireless phone carriers - ve ##riz ##on , at ##& ##t , t ##- ##mobile and sprint . [SEP] [CLS] the monthly prices for a single line of smartphone service with up to one gig ##aby ##te of cellular data at those carriers range from $ 45 to $ 50 compared to $ 30 from google . [SEP] [CLS] the major carriers , though , offer a variety of family plans that could still be better deals than project fi . [SEP] [CLS] those bundled plans allow several phone lines to share a pool of cellular data . [SEP] [CLS] besides trying to bring down the prices of wireless phone plans , google is promising subscribers that their nexus 6 model will automatically connect with the fastest network available . [SEP] [CLS] rather than building its own network , google is leasing space on cellular towers built by sprint and t ##- ##mobile , which are hoping the deals will boost their profits without costing them too many customers tempted to defect to project fi . [SEP] [CLS] to use the service , nexus 6 owners must sign ##- ##up to request an invitation , must have a gma ##il address , and must live
[CLS] a former ts ##a agent claims gr ##oping happens every day at security checkpoint ##s across the united states and staff routinely bend the rules to get their hands on passengers . [SEP] [CLS] jason edward harrington , who worked with the government agency for six years , added screen ##ers will often pull attractive travellers aside so they can inappropriate ##ly touch them and will conduct bag checks on people they simply do not like . [SEP] [CLS] his comments follow revelations that two ts ##a workers were fired for manipulating body scanner ##s in denver as part of a scheme to pat men down before they boarded their flights . [SEP] [CLS] writing for time magazine , he said the case was disturbing but admitted it came as no surprise to him . [SEP] [CLS] allegations : jason edward harrington , who worked with the ts ##a for six years , claims gr ##oping is a daily occurrence at security checkpoint ##s across the country and said staff of ` bending the rules ' so they could inappropriate ##ly touch passengers ( file picture ) [SEP] [CLS] ` over the course of my six years with the ts ##a , the lever ##aging of rules and surveillance tools to abuse passengers was a daily checkpoint occurrence , ' he said . [SEP] [CLS] ` and while it ' ##s easy to focus all the blame on the two un ##sa ##vor ##y screen ##ers who are now no longer with the agency , perhaps the bigger issue here is a systemic one : there are far too many federal hands on people ' ##s private parts in airports . [SEP] [CLS] he added : ` perhaps the most disturbing part of the sexual assault of male passengers at denver international via full ##- ##body scanner ##s is that the victims will likely never even know they were assaulted , since so many passengers have their private parts fond ##led when passing through the scanner ##s , anyway . [SEP] [CLS] ` it ' ##s difficult to tell where airport security ends and sexual assault begins these days . [SEP] [CLS] pat ##- ##down ##s of people ' ##s sensitive areas should be much rare ##r than they are at the airport . ' [SEP] [CLS] mr harrington also alleged the body scanner ##s , that are used by millions of americans every year , are ` practically useless ' . [SEP] [CLS] ` the ts ##a , in its rush to replace the controversial " nude " radiation scanner ##s that they phased out in 2013 , swapped out one poorly functioning line of machines for another . [SEP] [CLS] ` the current mill ##imeter wave scanner ##s , with their outrageous false ##- ##po ##sit ##ive rates , regularly cause unnecessary pat ##- ##down ##s : the agent running his or her hands over you after you pass through the scanner is almost never doing it
[CLS] the number of hay ##fe ##ver suffer ##ers in the uk is predicted to reach 20 million this summer , up a third from last year as warm weather bath ##es the country . [SEP] [CLS] for many , the glorious sunshine and promise of temperatures warmer than the mediterranean this week will come as a welcome relief . [SEP] [CLS] but for millions , the first tentative steps towards summer brings impending misery as a dread ##ed cloud of invisible pollen descends . [SEP] [CLS] experts told mail ##on ##line that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms - which include streaming eyes , inc ##ess ##ant s ##nee ##zing and irritating it ##ches at the back of the throat - for the first time . [SEP] [CLS] around 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hay ##fe ##ver symptoms this summer , up a third from last year , experts told mail ##on ##line [SEP] [CLS] and by 203 ##0 that figure is expected to surge to 31 ##. ##8 million suffer ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] dr jean em ##ber ##lin , a leading pollen expert , told mail ##on ##line that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hay ##fe ##ver this year could occur , ` depending on weather conditions ' . [SEP] [CLS] she said : ` if we get prolonged periods of warm , dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between , which helps the grass to keep growing , we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts . [SEP] [CLS] ` grass is the main cu ##lp ##rit pollen for hay ##fe ##ver in the uk . [SEP] [CLS] ` high and very high pollen counts can trigger hay ##fe ##ver symptoms in people who have not had them before . [SEP] [CLS] she added : ` in addition , the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution , which can make symptoms worse , and again lead them to occur in people who have been sy ##mpt ##om free before . ' [SEP] [CLS] in addition , she said pollen is becoming more potent , and greater numbers of plants giving off the all ##er ##gens is also contributing to a rising number of suffer ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] dr em ##ber ##lin said another contributing factor is that the average hay ##fe ##ver season is becoming longer , typically stretching from april to the end of august . [SEP] [CLS] she added : ` there is substantial evidence from pollen monitoring records and from vegetation surveys to show that the timing of some of the pollen seasons has been changing in the uk and across europe over the last few decades . [SEP] [CLS] hay ##fe ##ver seasons in the uk are becoming longer , as warmer weather in spring and autumn means pollen is typically ri ##fe from march to the end

[CLS] patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million gp appointments last year , shocking new figures have revealed . [SEP] [CLS] a study reported in the british medical journal found that 90 per cent of patients were able to get an appointment in 2013 ##/ ##14 . [SEP] [CLS] the 10 per cent who could not amounts to around 33 ##. ##8 million unsuccessful attempts each year - or 81 per surgery each week . [SEP] [CLS] the sham ##bolic situation is responsible for as many as a quarter of a ##& ##e visits , the researchers say . [SEP] [CLS] lack of access : patients tried and failed to book almost 34 million gp appointments last year [SEP] [CLS] the figures , from the gp patient survey , also show that patients who report worse access to conventional gp appointments are more likely to use out ##- ##of ##- ##ho ##urs services . [SEP] [CLS] and surge ##ries where patients were able to see a gp within two week days had lower rates of a ##& ##e department visits . [SEP] [CLS] other research has suggested that greater access to gp surge ##ries is linked with lower rates of emergency admissions for conditions such as heart failure and stroke . [SEP] [CLS] the figures come just a day after it was revealed one in five visits to a ##& ##e are unnecessary . [SEP] [CLS] a fifth of patients turning up in a ##& ##e have self ##- ##tre ##atable conditions including sore throat ##s , athlete ' ##s foot and head li ##ce , a study has claimed . [SEP] [CLS] researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary - ##- costing the nhs # 290 million . [SEP] [CLS] doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hung ##over , their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair . [SEP] [CLS] the analysis of data from 15 a ##& ##e units by consultancy firm im ##s health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a ` self ##- ##tre ##atable condition ' . [SEP] [CLS] the data covered one in ten a ##& ##e units across england , so if the trends are mirrored across the country , then an estimated 4 ##. ##1 million of the 21 ##. ##7 million visits last year were for minor ai ##lm ##ents .
